I know, it's a bit strange that this is all written in JSON, but look at it more like a template that defines and describes relationships between things, rather than straight-up Python, JavaScript, or any general-purpose programming language you're use to. This is for the cloud, specifically."

Specifically, it takes care of: (1) Distributing network requests across multiple servers. (2) Keeping track of your healthy servers aka servers that can respond to a request, and sending requests only to the healthy ones. (3) Making it really dang easy to add or subtract servers from a pool of computers."
